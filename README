Mosaic
------

A Python script to create a mosaic from smaller images building a larger image
using python's PIL. Currently it uses KDTree to sort tiles according to RGB
mean and selects n-nearest-neighbors for each section of the larger image from
the tree. It uses a tiling algorithm which renders a pattern of images with
translational symmetry. The plan is to add multi-threading support as the
mosaic composition problem is essentially parallelizable.
